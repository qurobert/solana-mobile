# Solana Mobile
Mobile app that captures an image through the camera, mints an NFT with that image, and adds the current location longitude, latitude in the metadata.

## Usage
```npm install```  
```npm run android``` (you should have Android Studio installed)

## Work In Progress
I miss the mint of the nft (i will use what i did for the cNFT collection of the exercice 8), we have the photo captured and the localisation saved only for now
